# Go dash [![Coverage Status][cov-img]][cov]

``go-dash`` is a modern Go library based on [reflect](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/).

Generic helpers rely on [reflect](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/), be careful, this code runs exclusively at runtime, so you must have a good test suite.

``go-dash`` may look like [lodash](https://lodash.com/) in JavaScript because I write the go-dash base on lodash, but it will have a version upgrade and have its own roadmap.

[Lodash](https://lodash.com/) is a popular and widely used JavaScript utility library that provides a comprehensive set of functions to work with arrays, objects, strings, functions, and more. It aims to simplify and streamline common programming tasks and data manipulation in JavaScript applications.

Why this name?
--------------

Because it is based on lodash and I write it with Golang, I decided to give it a name that is ``go-dash``. I hope everyone who can contribute to the ``go-dash`` will help make it more popular, flexible, and stable.
